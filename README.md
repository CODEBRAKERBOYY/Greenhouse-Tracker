## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18.0 or higher) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** (v6.0 or higher) - [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CODEBRAKERBOYY/Greenhouse-Tracker.git
cd Greenhouse-Tracker
```

### Step 2: Setup Backend

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
touch .env
```

**Add the following to `.env`:**

```env
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/greenhouse-tracker
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_in_production
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Start the backend server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

✅ Backend will run on: `http://localhost:3001`

### Step 3: Setup Frontend

**Open a NEW terminal window:**

```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

✅ Frontend will run on: `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 4: Verify Installation

- **Backend API**: Visit `http://localhost:3001` - Should display `{"message":"Server is working!"}`
- **Frontend**: Visit `http://localhost:5173` - Should show the Login page
- **Analytics API**: Visit `http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/overview` - Should return JSON data

## 🚀 Render Deployment

This project is configured for a single Render Web Service that builds the React frontend and serves it from the Express backend.

### Required Render Settings

Create the service from the **repository root**. Do not set the root directory to `server`.

```bash
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Start Command: npm start
```

The root `package.json` installs both apps and builds the frontend:

```bash
npm install --prefix server
npm install --prefix client
npm run build --prefix client
```

After deployment, Express serves the production React build from `client/dist`. API routes remain available under `/api`.

### Required Environment Variables

Set these in Render:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

`MONGODB_URI` must be a MongoDB Atlas connection string. Render does not provide local MongoDB, so `mongodb://localhost:27017/...` will not work in production.

### Frontend API URL

Production frontend requests use the same deployed domain:

```env
VITE_API_URL=/api
```

This avoids hardcoding a Render URL and keeps the app working if the deployment URL changes.

### Health Check

Use this endpoint to confirm the backend and database state:

```bash
GET /api/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

If the homepage shows only backend JSON, the frontend build was not generated or the service was deployed from the wrong directory.
